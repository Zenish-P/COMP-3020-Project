Must use the live server to run the project as without it Javascript won't run.
If you see any empty page that means you are not using live server to run the code.

Start with the Loginpage.html as it is the main starting page. Not the index.html.

Loginpage -> (Use any credentials for login) click "Login"

It will take us to the HomePage.
In the home page the playlists won't work and if any of the playlist is clicked
it will open the music player page (Because we haven't made it fully functional yet)

When Explore is clicked it will take us to the searchonlyBySongs page. You can also get here by using the search bar on the top right.

In the explore page you can search the songs, artists, genres and playlists. For now only the songs work. You can try pressin on the songs button.

When clicked on any of the songs it will take us to music player page.
Any other buttons dont work for now.

When clicked on Songs it will take us to the searchOnlyBySongs page where we see the list of songs.
Here in searchOnlyBySongs page we can add the songs to favourites or to the playlists(Functionality not added yet).

In the music player we have not included the next song and prev song buttons as they were breaking the whole page and due to time constraint we weren't able to fully finish the page.
