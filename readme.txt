when clicked on search and pressed enter we will get to the search page where we can see the filter
to search the song based on the songs, artists, genre and playlists. Of which only the songs work for now.

When clicked on any of the songs it will take us to music player page.
Any other buttons dont work for now.

When clicked on Songs it will take us to the searchOnlyBySongs page where we see the list of songs.
